Introduction
Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality of education in India. As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage.
Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies adopted by the organization.
Dedicated To Large-Scale Change
The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to create an adoptable demonstration model for state governments.
A Focus on Innovation
Pratham’s strategies reconfigure teaching methodologies, break down traditional tactics,and challenge the current rote learning mechanisms in our schools. Our programs are innovative and outcome-driven. In its early years Pratham developed innovative teaching-learning approaches, materials, and measurement methods. In 2005, we pioneered a nationwide survey of schooling and learning that has had a major impact on national and international policy discussions.
Low-Cost, Replicable Models
Pratham has worked to develop low-cost, replicable models that can easily spread and be adopted by other organizations. Thousands of volunteers work with Pratham to implement learning interventions at the grassroots level. These volunteers are mobilized, trained, and monitored by the Pratham team. They are also provided with teaching-learning material and books developed by Pratham. Not only does this ensure more effective implementation of the programs, but it also helps to build an infrastructure focused on providing quality education to children.
Programs Results and Accountability
All programs are designed to ensure that learning levels in schools and communities increase, education reaches all children who are in school or unable to use school facilities, and youth get well trained for job opportunities. Testing tools are also developed by the Pratham team to check the learning levels of children so as to determine the course of action best suited to each child and to assess impact of our programs.
A Powerful Voice in the Education Sector
Over the years, Pratham's advocacy in the education sector has become well recognized and regarded. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) has become an important input in the education policies of both the central and state governments with several state governments using

Introduction
Pratham started in Mumbai almost 25 years ago. Then and now, our vision is to ensure that every child is in schoolandlearning well. Then it was Mumbai. Now it is India. In fact, some of Pratham’s key approaches have also spread to Africa. To work towards this goal, Pratham provides a broad-based platform for activities in education and skill development across India.
By 2005, after just ten years of existence, Pratham’s presence had expanded to more than 10 states across India. We launched the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), and developed specialized initiatives aimed at tackling key challenges in Indian education. We believe that our work should be rigorously evaluated to test the impact and scalability of our innovations.  Today, we continue to grow, innovate and develop low-cost, high impact and scalable approaches with the goal of meeting the educational needs of millions of underprivileged children and youth across India.
Education
Ranging from early childhood to secondary school, Pratham’s education interventions work towards the goal of “every child in school and learning well”. Across all programs and delivery models, Pratham seeks to maximise impact at a low cost.
